# kafka-stream-sample

This example demonstrates the use of kafka streams to combine data from two streams(different topics) and sending them to a single stream(topic).

To run it and verify start your zookeeper an kafka broker on port 9092 and run GeneratorApp and Application.

To see the results create a kafka consumer for topic 'topic-out'
